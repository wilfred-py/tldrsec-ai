# TODOS

Tracker for follow-ups that surfaced during /ship gates but are not blocking the
current PR. Each entry includes priority, what surfaced it, and the smallest
viable next action.

## P1 — pre-existing test infrastructure (surfaced by /ship #486 baseline run)

Confirmed pre-existing on bare `origin/main` via stash + re-run (15 failed / 62 passed,
identical signature). Not caused by the X sentiment email integration.

- **`NotificationService.handleSummaryReadyEvent is not a function`** — and
  `getNotificationSubject is not a function`. Tests reference methods that no
  longer exist on the class. Either restore the methods or rewrite the tests
  against the current interface.
- **`EmailFooter` unsubscribe-link assertion returns `null`.** The test queries
  by text but the link is now built from a token-bearing href; the matcher
  needs an `href`-based lookup, not text.
- **`templates.test.ts` — `ERR_VM_DYNAMIC_IMPORT_CALLBACK_MISSING_FLAG` from
  `@react-email/render`.** Needs `NODE_OPTIONS='--experimental-vm-modules'`
  (or migration to a static-renderer test helper) so the dynamic import inside
  `@react-email/render` can resolve under Jest's VM.

**Smallest next action**: open a single `chore: fix pre-existing email test
infra` PR that addresses all three — they're cheap individually but each one
on its own is too small to ship.
