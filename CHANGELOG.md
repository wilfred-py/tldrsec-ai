# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

### Fixed
- JSON-LD structured data used wrong domain (`tldrsec.ai` instead of `tldrsec.app`)
- Removed broken SearchAction and unverified sameAs social links from structured data
- Sitemap listed non-existent routes (`/pricing`, `/about`) and auth-gated `/dashboard`
- robots.txt only blocked `/dashboard/settings` and `/dashboard/billing`, now blocks all auth-gated routes
- Homepage used `force-dynamic` unnecessarily, now statically generated for faster crawling

### Added
- Dynamic OG image generation (`app/opengraph-image.tsx`) with error handling and 24h cache
- High-intent SEC filing keywords across homepage and root metadata (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, Form 4)
- SEO validation test suite (11 tests) preventing regression on crawlability fixes
- `/subscribe` and `/waitlist` added to sitemap as actual public routes

### Changed

- Activity feed limited to 10 items with "Show all" expansion for faster initial render
- Activity feed date groups separated with shadcn Separator for visual breathing room
- Form 4 expand/collapse button uses shadcn Button component
- Dashboard shell and content spacing reduced for tighter layout
